Inventory management is important for renowned brands to control and manage the ordering and
storage of inventory. In order to optimize the management process, an inventory system is usually
implemented. In this idea, we aim to build a commodity inventory system that allows staff to **manage
and record commodity inventory** in **different retail shops** for monitoring inventory status, providing
necessary **data for procurements** and delivering **alerts** when exceptional events happened (e.g. some
commodity becomes **out-of-stock**). Minimally, the system shall include basic features: 

**1) search commodity according to different filters (e.g. in-stock/out-of-stock);**

**2) insert new commodity with basic information (name, manufacturer, amount, price, availability of shop(s)) after each procurement,**

**3) delete obsolete commodity;**

**4) update commodity information;**

**5) automatic change of inventory status according to the amount of commodity that is currently available (e.g. when the amount reaches zero, the inventory status would become “out-of-stock”);**

**6) deliver alerts when the commodity is “out-of-stock”. Imagine putting the system into reality and please suggests a function
that is not mentioned above, to be a function of your system.**
